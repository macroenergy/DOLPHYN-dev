#MacOrWindows: Mac  # Set to either "Mac" (also works for Linux) or "Windows" to ensure use of proper file directory separator "\" or "/
OverwriteResults: 0 # Overwrite existing results in output folder or create a new one; 0 = create new folder; 1 = overwrite existing results
PrintModel: 0 # Write the model formulation as an output; 0 = active; 1 = not active
SystemCO2Constraint: 2 # CO2 emissions constraint representation; 1 = Separate emissions constraint for HSC and Power; 2 = Combined emissions constraint for HSC and Power sectors (i.e. allow trading, with constraint form adopted from genx_settings)
Solver: gurobi # Available solvers: Gurobi, CPLEX, CLP, Cbc
WriteShadowPrices: 1 # Write shadow prices of LP or relaxed MILP; 0 = not active; 1 = active
OperationWrapping: 1 # Sets temporal resolution of the model; 0 = single period to represent the full year, with first-last time step linked; 1 = multiple representative periods
TimeDomainReductionFolder: "TDR_Results" # Directory name where results from time domain reduction will be saved. If results already exist here, these will be used without running time domain reduction script again.
TimeDomainReduction: 1 # Time domain reduce (i.e. cluster) inputs based on Load_data.csv, Generators_variability.csv, and Fuels_data.csv; 0 = not active (use input data as provided); 1 = active (cluster input data, or use data that has already been clustered)

Log: true # Flag whether log directed to file, turing this on will record basic output into log file and keep console io stream
